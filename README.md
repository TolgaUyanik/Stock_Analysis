This project is a stock market analysis tool designed to analyze stocks listed on the BIST100 (XU100.IS) index using the `yfinance` and `pandas` libraries. The script fetches stock data, processes it, and generates CSV files for stocks recommended for buying, holding, and selling based on various metrics.

## Features

- Fetches stock data for all BIST100 companies.
- Computes various metrics such as price-to-book ratio, potential gain, and how far the current price is from target prices.
- Generates recommendations for buying, holding, and selling stocks.
- Creates CSV files for easy analysis and further processing.
